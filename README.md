Arduino-CNC
===================

This project aims at developing a controller for both
the stepper motors and the high-frequency spindle
of an LPKF 101 LC/VS milling machine.
To achieve this aim, we will have to program an Arduino Mega2560
to control either H-bridges or MOSFETs (high current) or both.
LPKF kindly provided datasheets to support this project,
as the official controller is no longer manufactured.

All work, which is created in the context of this project is Open Hardware and Open Software.
Commercial use is allowed, as long as the modified hardware and software again
is provided openly without additional restrictions and all customers are informed about
where to find out more about their corresponding hardware and software.
